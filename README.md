In this project, we address the challenge of predicting the completion of online courses by analyzing learner activity logs. The task is framed as a binary classification problem â€” classifying learners into "Completed" or "Not Completed". Understanding such patterns can significantly improve course engagement strategies. Visualizations, particularly confusion matrices, will be used to interpret model performance
